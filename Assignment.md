============================

Here are the guidelines and deadlines for the final project.  The final project's goal is to integrate and apply the concepts we covered in this class. You can work in pairs on the same project. Working alone is also an option.  But groups of 3 or more students are not allowed. You can team up with someone in your lab section or another section.  By Friday, April 19 @ midnight, you have to submit a short 2-3 paragraphs project proposal/idea. Here is the submission link: 

- [Final Project Idea](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/108202/assignments/2252401) 

 Feel free to discuss the idea with your instructor or your TA before submitting it. They may also ask clarification questions.    If working in a team of two, both you and your teammate must submit the proposal idea and write your teammate's name on the proposal (please provide your teammate's lab section as well). 

 Project Requirements:  

At the very least, the project needs to include a finite-state machine, a register file, work on the boards in the lab, use the seven segments and/or LEDs for visualization, the switches for inputs, and do something cool (come up with your own project). The states of the FSM should cover the functionality of the design. Each state should set specific values for the control lines affecting the register file's operation. The contents of some registers could be visualized on the 7-segment displays. Depending on the state of the machine, different registers may be visualized. You will need a manual clock that is mapped to one of the buttons. Or you can slow down the board clock and use that instead.  These requirements may not all apply for more complex projects that use an alternative setup or equipment (for example, a complex TTL project) that you have at home, etc. In these cases, please discuss it with me and get my approval before submitting the project idea. If you are having a hard time deciding on a project idea, just walk around campus or your home until you see something that uses a 7-segment display. Then ask yourself, how does the controller for this gadget work? Can I build something simpler but similar? This should put you in creative mode.  To get credit for the project, you must present it to your TAs during your regular lab time during the week of April 28 - May 03 (dead week). Note that even if you are working with a partner, each one of you has to present the whole project to his/her lab TA. You also need to submit a PDF file with your final project report (approx. 15-20 pages long). The lab report should include the derivations of your design (state diagram, state table,... etc.) and screenshots of your implementation. Also, a zip file of your project. Both must be uploaded on Canvas. Completing the requirements for the project requires a significant time commitment, so start early and plan accordingly. 

Note that after you demo your project during your regular lab time, you must upload your project files on the same day and before 11:59 PM. Here is the submission link:

If you fail to demo your final project during your lab time, you will be allowed to demo it during any other lab section; however, a penalty of 15% will be applied to your final project grade. Best,  Dr. Mohamed [[Selenium|Selenium]]
