**Fetch**: In this state, the processor fetches the next instruction from memory.
**Decode**: In this state, the processor decodes the instruction to determine what operation to perform.
**Execute**: In this state, the processor executes the instruction.
**Memory**: In this state, the processor accesses memory to read or write data.
**Writeback**: In this state, the processor writes the results of the instruction to a register.
